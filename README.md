At the end of the course, I was able to build a bot with no code.

**Information Security Awareness (INFSEC101)**

The advent of information systems has made information the engine of the modern world. Due to its importance, modern organizations are not always as conservative as they might be.

define what information is, appreciate the value of information to the organization, understand the CIA triad of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, Understand the ISO standards followed at Bitonic, different threats to information, and how it affects an organization.
